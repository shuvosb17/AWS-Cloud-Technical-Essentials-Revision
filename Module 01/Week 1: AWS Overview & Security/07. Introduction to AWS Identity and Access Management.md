**IAM (Identity and Access Management)** is the **control center** of AWS.
If cloud security were a city, **IAM would be the police, keys, and rulebook combined**.

# 🔐 Why IAM Exists (The Big Problem)

Look at your **Employee Directory App** again. There are **multiple places** where access control is needed:

### 1️⃣ Application users

* Employees logging into the web app
* Username + password (app-level)

🚫 **IAM does NOT handle this**

---

### 2️⃣ Application → AWS Services

* Code running on **Amazon EC2**
* Needs to upload photos to **Amazon S3**

⚠️ Important rule:

> **Nothing in AWS is allowed by default**

Even EC2 → S3 calls:

* Must be **signed**
* Must be **authenticated**

---

### 3️⃣ Humans Managing AWS

* You
* Other developers
* Network admins
* Ops engineers

Everyone needs:

* A login
* Correct permissions
* NO root access

🔥 **IAM solves #2 and #3**

---

# 🧠 What Is IAM?

> **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** controls:

* **Who** can access AWS (authentication)
* **What** they can do (authorization)

IAM is:

* Global (not region-specific)
* Free
* Core to AWS security

---

# 🔑 Authentication vs Authorization (VERY IMPORTANT)

These two words are exam favorites 👇

## 🔐 Authentication — *Who are you?*

* Did you log in correctly?
* Username + password
* MFA check

👉 IAM **users** handle authentication

---

## 🚦 Authorization — *What can you do?*

* Can you launch EC2?
* Can you delete S3?
* Can you change networking?

👉 IAM **policies** handle authorization

---

# 👤 IAM Users (Humans)

### What is an IAM User?

* Represents **one person**
* Has:

  * Username
  * Password (console)
  * Access keys (CLI / SDK)

🚫 Never share IAM users
✅ One user per human

---

# 📜 IAM Policies (Permissions)

IAM policies answer:

> “Are you allowed to do this API call?”

### Key facts:

* Written in **JSON**
* Attached to:

  * Users
  * Groups
  * Roles

---

## 🧩 Policy Structure (Simple)

Every policy has:

| Element   | Meaning               |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Effect    | Allow / Deny          |
| Action    | AWS API call          |
| Resource  | Which resource        |
| Condition | Optional restrictions |

### Example (conceptual):

* Allow: `ec2:RunInstances`
* Deny: everything else

🔥 **AWS permissions can be VERY granular**

---

# 👥 IAM Groups (Best Practice)

### What is a Group?

* Collection of IAM users
* Permissions attached **to the group**

### Why groups matter:

* Easier management
* Cleaner security
* Real-world teams

Example:

* Developers group
* Network admins group
* Read-only auditors group

👉 **Attach policies to groups, not users** (BEST PRACTICE)

---

# 🚨 Root User vs IAM User (CRITICAL)

### Root user:

* Cannot have policies
* Too powerful
* Dangerous

### Best practice flow:

1. Enable MFA on root ✅
2. Create IAM user with admin permissions
3. Log out root
4. NEVER use root again

🔥 This is **professional AWS behavior**

---

# 🤖 What About EC2 → S3 Access?

Important moment in the lesson 👇

❌ **Do NOT**:

* Create IAM user
* Hardcode username/password into EC2

That’s insecure 💥

✅ Instead:

* Use **IAM Roles** (coming next!)

Roles provide:

* Temporary credentials
* No passwords
* Auto-rotated keys

🔥 This is how AWS wants you to do it

---

# 🧠 What IAM Does vs Does NOT Do

| Area                      | IAM? |
| ------------------------- | ---- |
| AWS account access        | ✅    |
| Service-to-service access | ✅    |
| API call permissions      | ✅    |
| App user login (website)  | ❌    |
| App-level auth            | ❌    |

---

# ✅ Final Mental Model (LOCK THIS IN)

```
Human → IAM User → IAM Group → IAM Policy
App on EC2 → IAM Role → AWS Services
```

Everything in AWS:
➡️ **Authentication first**
➡️ **Authorization second**
➡️ **API call always**
