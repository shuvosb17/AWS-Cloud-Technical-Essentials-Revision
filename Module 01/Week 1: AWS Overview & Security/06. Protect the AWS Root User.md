# 👑 What Is the AWS Root User?

When you create an AWS account:

* You sign up with an **email**
* You set a **password**

👉 That **email + password = ROOT USER**

### 🚨 Root User Facts (VERY IMPORTANT)

* Has **unrestricted access**
* Can **do anything**
* Cannot be limited by permissions
* Is **more powerful than admins**

💡 If you log in with email + password →
❗ **You are the root user**

---

## 🧨 Why the Root User Is Dangerous

The lesson gives a scary (but realistic) example:

A bad actor:

* Logs in as root
* Deletes all your data ❌
* Spins up crypto mining 💸💸💸
* Leaves you with the bill 😭

🔥 This happens **in real life** — not a joke.

# 🔐 Password Alone Is NOT Enough

A strong password helps, but:

* Password only = **Single-Factor Authentication**
* If password is stolen → **Game over**

👉 AWS best practice:

## **Enable MFA IMMEDIATELY on the root user**

---

# 🔑 MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) — Your Shield

## What MFA Means

To log in, you need:

1. Something you **know** → password
2. Something you **have** → phone / device

Even if someone cracks your password:
❌ They **still cannot log in**

---

## 📱 How MFA Works (Simple)

* You enter email + password
* AWS asks for **one-time code**
* Code is generated by:

  * Mobile app (most common)
  * Physical device

The code:

* Changes every few seconds
* Works only once

## ✅ MOST IMPORTANT RULE (EXAM + REAL LIFE)

> **Always enable MFA on the root user**

AWS doesn’t force it —
but **professionals ALWAYS do it**.

---

# 🚫 Do NOT Use Root User Daily

Another critical rule 👇

### ❌ Never use root for:

* Creating EC2
* Uploading files
* Managing services
* Admin work

### ✅ Root user is ONLY for:

* Initial account setup
* Billing changes
* Closing account
* Rare account-level actions

👉 For everything else, use **IAM users** (coming next!)

---

# 🧠 Why This Matters (Big Picture)

| Bad Practice      | Result              |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| No MFA            | Account takeover    |
| Daily root usage  | Huge risk           |
| Shared root creds | Disaster            |
| IAM + MFA         | Safe & professional |

---

# 📌 Golden Checklist (DO THIS NOW)

When you create an AWS account:

✅ Enable MFA on root
✅ Store root credentials securely
✅ Stop using root daily
✅ Create IAM users instead

If you do just this —
🔥 You’re already better than many beginners.
