# 📘 Reading 1.2: **What is AWS?**

## ☁️ First Question: *What is “the Cloud”?*

### 🏢 Old World (On-Premises)

In the past, companies had to:

* Buy **physical servers**
* Buy **storage devices**
* Buy **network equipment**
* Hire teams to maintain them 🔧
* Pay electricity, cooling, space 💸

👉 Result:
❌ Very expensive
❌ Slow to change
❌ Hard to experiment

---

### 🌐 New World (Cloud Computing)

> **Cloud computing = on-demand IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing**

That’s the *official* definition.
Now let’s translate it to **human language** 👇

✅ You **rent** servers instead of buying
✅ You get them **instantly**
✅ You pay **only when you use them**
✅ Someone else manages the hardware (AWS!)

## 🧠 So… Where Does AWS Fit In?

👉 **AWS is the company that provides the cloud**

More precisely:

> **Amazon Web Services provides IT resources (servers, storage, databases, networking) as services over the internet**

Instead of you owning:

* Servers ❌
* Data centers ❌
* Networking hardware ❌

AWS owns and manages them ✅
You just **use them**.

## 🧪 Real Example: QA Environment (VERY IMPORTANT)

### 🧱 On-Prem Scenario

Your team wants a **QA environment** identical to production.

You must:

1. Buy hardware
2. Install OS
3. Connect cables
4. Configure networking
5. Wait days or weeks 😩

⏳ **Time-to-market increases**

---

### ☁️ Cloud Scenario

Same requirement, but in AWS:

1. Click → copy environment
2. Done in **minutes or seconds** ⚡

🎯 **This is why companies love the cloud**

---

## 🏋️ Undifferentiated Heavy Lifting (KEY TERM 🔑)

This is an **AWS exam + interview favorite**.

### ❓ What does it mean?

> Tasks that **don’t make your business unique**

Examples:

* Installing servers
* Managing backups
* Power & cooling
* Patching OS

🚫 These don’t make your product special
✅ Your **code & logic** do

👉 **AWS removes this burden** so you focus on:

* Business logic
* Features
* Customers

## 🧩 AWS in THIS Course (Employee Directory App)

AWS services will help you build:

* ✅ **Scalable**
* ✅ **Highly available**
* ✅ **Cost-effective**

infrastructure for your app.

You’ll use AWS to:

* Run backend code
* Store employee data
* Store images
* Monitor performance
* Scale automatically

🔥 Without touching a single physical server.

# ⭐ The 6 BIG Benefits of Cloud Computing (MEMORIZE LOGIC, NOT WORDS)

Let’s break these down **one by one, simply** 👇

---

## 1️⃣ Pay As You Go 💸

* No upfront cost
* Pay only for what you use

📌 Like electricity or mobile data

---

## 2️⃣ Massive Economies of Scale 📉

AWS serves **millions of customers**.

👉 They buy hardware cheaper than you ever could
👉 You get **lower prices**

---

## 3️⃣ Stop Guessing Capacity 🎯

On-prem:

* Buy too much → waste money
* Buy too little → app crashes

Cloud:

* Scale up ⬆️ when traffic increases
* Scale down ⬇️ when traffic drops

---

## 4️⃣ Speed & Agility ⚡

* Servers in **minutes**
* Experiment freely
* Faster feature delivery

💡 Perfect for startups & fast teams

---

## 5️⃣ No Data Center Headaches 🏭❌

No:

* Racking servers
* Power management
* Cooling systems

👉 Focus on **what differentiates your business**

---

## 6️⃣ Go Global in Minutes 🌍

Deploy apps in:

* Asia
* Europe
* America

🎯 Lower latency, better user experience
