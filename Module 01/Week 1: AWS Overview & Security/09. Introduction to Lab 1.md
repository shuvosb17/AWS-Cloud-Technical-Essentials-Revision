# 🧪 Introduction to Lab 1: IAM in Action

Up to now, you’ve learned:

* Shared Responsibility Model
* Root user protection
* IAM users, groups, policies
* IAM roles

👉 **This lab exists to convert that knowledge into muscle memory**

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Lab (High Level)

By the end of this lab, you should be able to say:

> “I understand how AWS controls *who can do what*.”

Not theoretically — **practically**.

---

## 🧭 What You’ll Do in This Lab

You’ll work inside the **IAM Dashboard**, where AWS security lives.

### 🔍 1️⃣ Explore IAM Components

You’ll look at **pre-created**:

* Users 👤
* Groups 👥
* Roles 🎭
* Policies 📜

💡 This helps you understand how **real AWS accounts are structured**.

---

### 👤 2️⃣ Manage IAM Users

You’ll:

* Add users
* Assign them to groups

👉 This teaches **authentication**:

> *Who is allowed to log in?*

---

### 👥 3️⃣ Work with IAM Groups

You’ll:

* Add users to groups
* Let users **inherit permissions**

👉 This teaches **authorization**:

> *What is a user allowed to do?*

🔥 You’ll see why **groups > individual permissions**.

---

### 🔐 4️⃣ Test Permissions in Real Services

You’ll:

* Log in as **different IAM users**
* Try accessing different AWS services
* See what works ❌ / ✅

This answers the most important question:

> “Why can THIS user do this, but THAT user cannot?”

---

## 🧠 What This Lab Is ACTUALLY Teaching You

Behind the scenes, you are learning:

| Concept             | You’ll See                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Least privilege     | Some actions denied             |
| Group-based access  | Permissions inherited           |
| IAM enforcement     | AWS blocks unauthorized actions |
| Security boundaries | Not everyone is admin           |

🔥 This is **real enterprise AWS behavior**.

---

## ⚠️ Important Mindset for the Lab

### ❌ Don’t rush

### ❌ Don’t just “finish steps”

### ✅ Observe outcomes

### ✅ Ask “WHY did this work?”

If something fails — **that’s GOOD**.
Security is about **controlled failure**.

---

## 🧩 How This Fits the Course

This lab:

* Matches what you learned in videos
* Prepares you for **future labs**
* Builds confidence before EC2, S3, RDS labs

👉 Every future AWS service will rely on IAM.

---

## ✅ Golden Checklist Before You Start

Make sure you remember:

* Root user ≠ daily user
* Users authenticate
* Policies authorize
* Groups simplify management
* Roles are for services (later labs)

If these ideas are clear — you’re READY 🚀

After the lab, we can:

* Review what you saw
* Fix confusion
* Prep for the Week 1 quiz
