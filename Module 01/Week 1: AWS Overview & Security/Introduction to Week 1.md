# 🌍 Week 1: What Are We REALLY Doing?

### 🎯 Goal of Week 1

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

* **Understand what cloud computing is**
* **Explain why AWS exists**
* **Speak AWS language confidently**
* **Secure an AWS account from Day 1** 🔐

This week is about **thinking**, not memorizing.

## 🧠 AWS Learning = 4 Ingredients

The instructor said something very important 👇

> Working with AWS is **part theory, part technical knowledge, part vocabulary, and LOTS of practice**

Let’s decode that:

| Part               | What it means                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 📘 **Theory**      | Why cloud exists, when to use it     |
| 🛠️ **Technical**  | How services actually work           |
| 🗣️ **Vocabulary** | AWS words (EC2, VPC, IAM, etc.)      |
| 🧪 **Practice**    | Clicking, building, breaking, fixing |

👉 This course balances **all four** — that’s why it’s good.

## ☁️ What Is Cloud Computing? (Ultra Simple)

### ❌ Old Way (On-Premise)

* Buy servers 💰
* Maintain hardware 🔧
* Fixed capacity 😐
* Scaling is painful 😭

### ✅ Cloud Way (AWS)

* Rent servers 🏠
* Pay only for what you use 💸
* Scale in minutes ⚡
* High availability built-in 🛡️

> **Cloud = On-demand computing resources over the internet**

---

## 🌍 AWS Global Infrastructure (Big Concept)

AWS is **not one data center**.
It’s a **global network** of data centers.

You’ll soon learn:

* **Regions** → Physical locations (e.g., Asia, Europe)
* **Availability Zones (AZs)** → Multiple isolated data centers *inside* a region

🎯 Why this matters?

* **Fault tolerance**
* **High availability**
* **Low latency**

## 🧩 How You’ll Learn AWS (Very Smart Approach)

Instead of random services, the course uses a **real application** 👇

## 🧑‍💼 Employee Directory Web App

This is a **CRUD app** (Create, Read, Update, Delete):

### What users can do:

* Add employees
* Edit employee info
* Upload employee photos
* Delete employees

💡 This is **exactly like real backend systems** you’ll build in your career.

## 🏗️ How This App Is Built on AWS (High Level)

Let’s map app features → AWS services 👇

### 🧠 Think of it like this:

| App Part     | AWS Service   | Simple Meaning                   |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Backend code | EC2           | Virtual servers                  |
| Database     | RDS           | Managed SQL database             |
| Images       | S3            | Unlimited file storage           |
| Network      | VPC           | Private network                  |
| Traffic      | Load Balancer | Distributes requests             |
| Scaling      | Auto Scaling  | Add/remove servers automatically |
| Monitoring   | CloudWatch    | Logs & metrics                   |
| Security     | IAM           | Who can access what              |

🔥 **THIS diagram is the heart of the entire course**

Don’t worry — you’ll build this **step by step**.

## 🔐 Why Security Comes EARLY (Very Important)

The instructor emphasized this for a reason 👇

> “As soon as you create an AWS account, security matters.”

You’ll learn:

* **Shared Responsibility Model**
* **IAM (Identity & Access Management)**

💥 Mistake beginners make:

> Leaving everything open → hacked → bill shock 😨

We won’t let that happen.
