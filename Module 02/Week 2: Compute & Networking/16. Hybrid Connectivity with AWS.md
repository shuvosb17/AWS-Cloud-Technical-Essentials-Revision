## 🌐 Hybrid Connectivity with **Amazon Web Services**

### ❓ Why do we need hybrid connectivity?

> Because many systems run **partly in AWS and partly on-premises**.

This is called a **hybrid model**.

---

## 🧠 Basic setup (easy picture in head)

```
On-prem Data Center  ⇄  AWS VPC
```

* AWS side → **VPC**
* On-prem side → Your own data center
* Need a **secure connection** between them

---

## 🔌 Main Connectivity Options (VERY IMPORTANT)

### 1️⃣ **AWS VPN**

Secure connection **over the internet**

#### Types:

* **Site-to-Site VPN**
  → Data center ⇄ VPC
* **Client VPN**
  → User laptop ⇄ AWS / data center

✔ Encrypted
✔ Easy to set up
❌ Uses public internet
❌ Less stable latency

---

### 2️⃣ **AWS Direct Connect**

Private, dedicated connection to AWS

✔ Does **NOT** use public internet
✔ More stable & high throughput
✔ Lower latency
❌ More expensive
❌ Takes time to set up

---

## 🚪 Gateway Concept (VERY EASY)

| Gateway                     | Purpose                 |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Internet Gateway            | Door to internet        |
| **Virtual Private Gateway** | Door to on-prem network |

VPN & Direct Connect **both use the Virtual Private Gateway**.

---

## 🆚 VPN vs Direct Connect (Quick Compare)

| Feature       | VPN    | Direct Connect |
| ------------- | ------ | -------------- |
| Internet used | ✅ Yes  | ❌ No           |
| Setup         | Fast   | Slower         |
| Cost          | Lower  | Higher         |
| Reliability   | Medium | High           |
| Throughput    | Lower  | Higher         |

---

## 🏆 Best Practice (Real World)

> **Use Direct Connect for primary traffic
> Use VPN as backup (failover)**

---

## 🧠 One-Line Summary (MEMORIZE THIS)

> **Hybrid connectivity connects on-prem data centers to AWS using VPN or Direct Connect.**

That’s all you need ✅

Not every company goes **all-in cloud** on day one ☁️
Many real-world systems are **hybrid** — part in AWS, part in an on-premises data center.

Let’s break this down **conceptually**, **visually**, and **practically** 👇

---

# 🧩 What Is Hybrid Connectivity?

**Hybrid architecture** means:

```
On-Premises Data Center  ⇄  AWS Cloud (VPC)
```

* Some workloads stay **on-prem**
* Some run in **AWS**
* They must **communicate securely and reliably**

Your AWS side lives inside a **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**
Your on-prem side is your **data center or corporate network**

---

# 🔑 The Core Question

> ❓ *How do we securely connect a private data center to a private AWS VPC?*

AWS gives **two main answers**:

1. **AWS VPN** (Encrypted over the internet)
2. **AWS Direct Connect** (Private, dedicated connection)

---

# 🔐 Option 1: AWS VPN

### What is AWS VPN?

A **secure, encrypted tunnel** over the public internet.

Think of it like:

> 🧠 *A secure tunnel dug through the internet*

---

## 🧭 Types of AWS VPN

### 1️⃣ **AWS Site-to-Site VPN**

📍 *Data center ↔ AWS VPC*

**Use when:**

* You want your **on-prem network** to talk to AWS
* Servers on both sides need access to each other

**How it works:**

```
On-Prem Router
     ⇄ (Encrypted Tunnel)
Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)
     ⇄
AWS VPC
```

---

### 2️⃣ **AWS Client VPN**

📍 *Individual users ↔ AWS*

**Use when:**

* Admins/devs connect from laptops
* Similar to corporate VPN software

🧑‍💻 *“I connect to AWS from my laptop securely”*
