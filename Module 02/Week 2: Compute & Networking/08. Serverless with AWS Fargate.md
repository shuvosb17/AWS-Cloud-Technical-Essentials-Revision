# ⚡ Serverless with **AWS Fargate**

## 🧠 Quick Recap (So Everything Connects)

You already know:

* **Containers** package app + dependencies
* **Orchestration** manages containers at scale
* AWS orchestration tools:

  * **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)**
  * **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**

But containers still need **compute** to run on.

---

## 🖥️ The Old Container Model (EC2-backed)

Containers used to run like this:

```
ECS / EKS
   ↓
EC2 instances
   ↓
OS + patching + scaling (YOU manage)
```

That means:

* You provision EC2
* You patch OS
* You manage cluster size
* You scale infrastructure

❌ Not serverless
❌ Operational overhead still exists

---

# 🚀 Enter **AWS Fargate**

### 👉 **AWS Fargate**

> **Fargate is a serverless compute platform for containers**

It works with:

* ECS ✅
* EKS ✅

## ☁️ What “Serverless Containers” Really Means

With Fargate:

❌ No EC2 instances
❌ No OS patching
❌ No cluster capacity planning
❌ No infrastructure scaling

✅ Built-in scaling
✅ Built-in fault tolerance
✅ Pay only for resources used

You **never see the servers**.

---

## 🧠 Your New Responsibility Model (VERY IMPORTANT)

### You define:

* Container image
* CPU & memory
* Networking
* Storage
* Scaling rules

### AWS handles:

* Servers
* OS
* Patching
* Availability
* Scaling infrastructure

This is **pure serverless convenience** ✨

---

## 📦 How Fargate Works (Step by Step)

1️⃣ Build your container image
2️⃣ Push it to a registry like
👉 **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**
3️⃣ Define:

* vCPU
* Memory
* Storage
  4️⃣ Run the container as:
* **Task** (ECS)
* **Pod** (EKS)
  5️⃣ AWS runs it for you
  6️⃣ You pay only for what’s used

---

## 💸 Pricing Model (Simple & Fair)

You pay for:

* vCPU used
* Memory used
* Storage used
* Duration container runs

Just like EC2:

* Supports **Spot pricing**
* Supports **Savings Plans**

📌 But pricing is **per container**, not per server.

---

## ⚖️ Control vs Convenience (Revisited)

| Platform          | Control | Ops Work |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------- |
| EC2               | 🔥🔥🔥  | 🔥🔥🔥   |
| Containers on EC2 | 🔥🔥    | 🔥🔥     |
| **Fargate**       | 🔥      | 🔥       |

> **Fargate trades low-level control for massive simplicity**

---

## 🧠 When Fargate Is PERFECT

Fargate shines for:

* Microservices 🧩
* APIs
* Batch jobs
* ML workloads
* Migrating on-prem apps
* Teams who don’t want infra ops

Especially good when:

* Traffic is unpredictable
* Team is small
* Speed > control

---

## 🧠 When Fargate Might NOT Fit

Avoid Fargate if:

* You need deep OS control
* You need custom kernel features
* You already heavily optimize EC2 clusters

Again — **choice, not rules**.

---

## 🧠 Mental Model (Lock This In)

```
ECS / EKS = brains (orchestration)
Fargate   = body (compute)
```

No servers to babysit 🧑‍🍼❌

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

✔ Fargate = serverless containers
✔ Works with ECS & EKS
✔ No EC2 to manage
✔ Built-in scaling & HA
✔ Pay per vCPU & memory
✔ Ideal for modern microservices
