# ⚡ Introduction to **AWS Lambda**

AWS Lambda is **event-driven, serverless compute**.

That means:

> You **upload code**, define **when it should run**, and AWS runs it **only when needed**.

No servers.
No containers.
No instances.
No idle cost. 😍

## 🧠 The Core Idea (Very Simple)

Traditional compute:

```
Server always ON → waiting for requests → you pay 24/7
```

Lambda:

```
Event happens → code runs → finishes → stops
```

👉 **No event = no cost**

## 📦 What Is a Lambda Function?

A **Lambda function** is:

* A piece of code
* Uploaded to AWS
* Written in a supported language
* Triggered by events

Supported languages include:

* Python 🐍
* Java
* Node.js
* Go
* .NET
* Ruby
  (and more)

---

## 🚨 Lambda Runs Only When Triggered

A Lambda function is **NOT always running**.

It runs **only when triggered**.

### Common Triggers 🔔

* HTTP request (via API Gateway)
* File upload to **Amazon S3**
* Database change (DynamoDB)
* Events from other AWS services
* Mobile app activity
* Scheduled events (cron jobs)

---

## ⚙️ What AWS Manages vs What YOU Control

### AWS handles (100%):

✔ Servers
✔ Scaling
✔ High availability
✔ OS patching
✔ Fault tolerance

### You control:

✔ Code
✔ Runtime (Python, Node, etc.)
✔ Memory & CPU
✔ Permissions (IAM role)
✔ Environment variables

This is **maximum convenience** in AWS.

---

## ⏱️ Important Lambda Limits (Know This!)

🚫 **Max execution time: 15 minutes**

So Lambda is **NOT for**:

* Long batch jobs
* Training ML models
* Hosting WordPress
* Always-on servers

✅ Lambda is PERFECT for:

* APIs
* Microservices
* Image processing
* File conversions
* Event processing
* Background jobs

---

## 💰 Lambda Pricing (One of the BEST Parts)

You are billed for:

* **Execution time**
* **Memory used**
* **Rounded to the nearest millisecond**

💡 If your function doesn’t run → **you pay nothing**

This is why Lambda is insanely cost-effective.

## 🧠 Real Example from the Lesson (Image Resizer)

Let’s simplify the demo:

### Goal 🎯

Whenever a photo is uploaded:
➡ Automatically resize it
➡ Save thumbnail version

### Flow:

```
Photo uploaded to S3
        ↓
S3 triggers Lambda
        ↓
Lambda resizes image
        ↓
Thumbnail saved to S3
```

Perfect Lambda use case ✔
No EC2 needed ✔
No always-on server ✔

## 🧑‍💻 Lambda Demo Steps (Conceptual)

1️⃣ Create Lambda function
2️⃣ Choose runtime (Python 3.9)
3️⃣ Attach IAM role (S3 access)
4️⃣ Add trigger (S3 PUT event)
5️⃣ Upload function code (ZIP)
6️⃣ Upload image to S3
7️⃣ Lambda runs automatically 🎉

---

## 🔐 Permissions Matter (IAM Reminder)

Lambda **never gets permissions by default**.

You must attach an **IAM role**:

* Example: read/write S3
* Least privilege is best practice

---

## 🧠 Lambda vs Fargate vs EC2 (Mental Model)

| Service    | Runs       | Duration     | Best For              |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| EC2        | VM         | Always       | Full control          |
| Fargate    | Containers | Long-running | Serverless containers |
| **Lambda** | Functions  | Short        | Event-driven logic    |

Think:

* **Lambda = code**
* **Fargate = containers**
* **EC2 = servers**

---

## 🚀 Can You Build Full Apps with Lambda?

✅ YES (with refactoring)

Typical Lambda stack:

* Lambda (compute)
* API Gateway (HTTP)
* DynamoDB (database)
* S3 (storage)

This is **true serverless architecture**.

---

## 🧠 Final Takeaways (Lock These In)

✔ Lambda is **event-driven**
✔ Runs only when triggered
✔ Auto-scales instantly
✔ No servers or containers
✔ Max 15 minutes runtime
✔ Pay per millisecond
✔ Perfect for microservices
