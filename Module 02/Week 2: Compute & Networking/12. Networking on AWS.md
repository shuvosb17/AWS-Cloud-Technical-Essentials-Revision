🌐 **Networking on AWS — Clear Foundations Before VPC Deep Dive**

This lesson sets the **context** for AWS networking and explains **why VPCs matter**, especially when running applications on EC2. Let’s break it down cleanly and intuitively 👇

## 🧠 Why Networking Matters on AWS

Every application needs a **network** to communicate:

* Users accessing your app
* Services talking to each other
* Secure access to databases, storage, APIs

On AWS, **networking = VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**.

---

## 🚀 The Starting Point: Default VPC

When you earlier launched an EC2 instance, you:

* Didn’t build a network manually
* Simply selected the **default VPC**

AWS automatically creates a **default VPC** in **every region** so you can get started quickly.

### What default VPCs are good for

✅ Fast experimentation
✅ Learning & demos
✅ Quick internet access

### ⚠️ But here’s the catch

Default VPCs:

* Are **internet-facing by default**
* Automatically allow public access
* Are **not ideal for production workloads**

> Anything you put inside a default VPC is potentially exposed to the internet.

## 🔐 Why You Need a Custom VPC

To build **secure and production-ready architectures**, you should create a **custom VPC**.

A custom VPC allows you to:

* Control **who can access what**
* Decide **which resources are public or private**
* Apply **granular security rules**
* Follow best practices for real-world systems

📌 This section of the course focuses on **building that custom VPC**.

## 🧱 Networking Depends on Your Compute Choice

### If you use **Amazon EC2**

* Networking is **mandatory**
* EC2 instances **must live inside a VPC**
* Subnets, routing, gateways all matter

### If you use **AWS Lambda**

* You **may not need a VPC at all**
* Lambda can run fully managed without networking
* (VPC is optional, only for special cases)

💡 **Key insight**

> Networking is essential for most AWS architectures, even if not every service requires it.

## 🧩 What’s Coming Next

In the next lessons, you’ll learn:

* Core **VPC concepts**
* How traffic flows in AWS
* How to design **secure network boundaries**
* How EC2, subnets, and gateways work together

Before that, the **upcoming notes** will cover:

* Basic networking concepts
* Terminology you must know
* Mental models that make VPCs easier

---

## 🏁 Big Takeaway

* AWS networking is built around **VPC**
* Default VPC = quick start, **not production**
* Custom VPC = **security, control, best practice**
* Even in serverless-heavy architectures, networking knowledge is **foundational**
