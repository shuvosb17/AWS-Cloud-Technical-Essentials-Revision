AWS gives you **multiple compute options**, and **each one shines in different scenarios**.
This lesson uses a fun *game-show style* approach, but the logic is **very real-world**.

Let’s break it down cleanly 👇

---

## 🏗️ The Main Compute Options You’ve Learned

* **Amazon EC2** → Virtual machines
* **AWS Lambda** → Event-driven functions
* **Amazon ECS** → Managed containers
* **Amazon EKS** → Kubernetes on AWS

---

## 🎮 Game Show Scenario #1

### 📦 *Quarterly inventory upload → database update*

**Problem**

* Inventory spreadsheet uploaded to **Amazon S3**
* Happens **once per quarter**
* Needs to automatically update a database

### ❌ Why NOT EC2?

* EC2 would sit idle most of the time
* You’d pay even when nothing happens

### ✅ Best Choice: **AWS Lambda**

**Why Lambda wins 🏆**

* Runs **only when triggered**
* No idle cost
* S3 upload can directly trigger Lambda
* Perfect for **infrequent, event-based work**

💡 **Rule learned**

> If it runs **occasionally** and is **event-driven** → **Lambda**

---

## 🎮 Game Show Scenario #2

### 🏢 *Migrate an on-prem Linux app to AWS*

**Requirements**

* App already runs on Linux
* Minimal refactoring
* Needs elasticity (scale up/down)

### ✅ Best Choice: **Amazon EC2**

**Why EC2 wins 🏆**

* Same Linux environment as on-prem
* Lift-and-shift friendly
* Supports auto scaling
* No major code rewrite needed

### ❌ Why NOT Lambda / Containers?

* Lambda → heavy refactoring
* Containers → re-architecting required

💡 **Rule learned**

> If you want **minimum refactor** → **EC2**

---

## 🎮 Game Show Scenario #3

### 🧩 *Brand-new microservices application*

**Goals**

* Fast scaling
* Easy deployments
* Lower risk when releasing changes
* Service-oriented / microservices design

### ✅ Best Choice: **ECS or EKS**

**Why containers win 🏆**

* Containers boot fast ⚡
* Perfect for microservices
* High portability (dev → prod consistency)
* Easier rollbacks & safer deployments

**ECS vs EKS?**

* ECS → AWS-native, simpler
* EKS → Kubernetes standard, more control

💡 **Rule learned**

> Microservices + fast scaling → **Containers**

## 🧭 The Ultimate Mental Model (EXAM & REAL LIFE GOLD)

| Use Case                      | Best Service         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Lift & shift apps             | **EC2**              |
| Event-driven, infrequent jobs | **Lambda**           |
| Microservices                 | **ECS / EKS**        |
| Fast scale + portability      | **Containers**       |
| Minimal ops                   | **Lambda / Fargate** |

---

## ⚖️ Convenience vs Control Spectrum

```
More Control  ←──────────────→  More Convenience
   EC2        Containers       Lambda
```

* EC2 → Maximum control
* Containers → Balanced
* Lambda → Maximum convenience

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways (Lock These In)

✔ Don’t use **one compute service for everything**
✔ Optimize for **cost, scalability, and effort**
✔ Re-evaluate choices as AWS evolves
✔ Pick the **right tool for the job**, not your favorite tool

---

## 🚀 Final Thought

AWS compute is not about:

> “Which service is best?”

It’s about:

> **“Which service is best for THIS use case?”**
