This lab is a **hands-on checkpoint** 🚦
Here’s where everything you’ve learned about **networking + compute + security** finally comes together.

Think of **Lab 2** as **assembling a full system**, not learning a single feature.

---

# 🎯 What You’ll Accomplish in Lab 2

By the end of this lab, you will have:

✅ Built a **custom AWS network**
✅ Launched a **working web application**
✅ Enabled **secure internet access**
✅ Verified everything actually works in a browser 🌐

---

# 🧠 Big Picture (Visualize First)

```
Internet
  ↓
Internet Gateway
  ↓
Public Subnet
  ↓
EC2 Instance
  ↓
Employee Directory App
```

This is **exactly how real-world AWS applications are deployed**.

# 🧩 Lab 2 – Step-by-Step Conceptual Breakdown

## 1️⃣ Build the Network (Foundation Layer)

You’ll first create a **custom VPC** instead of using the default one.

### Why this matters

* Default VPCs are **convenient**
* Custom VPCs are **secure, controlled, and production-ready**

📌 This network will include:

* A VPC
* Public subnet(s)
* Routing to the internet

---

## 2️⃣ Launch an EC2 Instance (Compute Layer)

You’ll launch an **Amazon EC2 instance** into a **public subnet**.

### Key idea

> Where you launch an instance matters just as much as how you configure it.

Public subnet =
✔ Can reach the internet
✔ Can be reached *from* the internet (when allowed)

---

## 3️⃣ Use User Data (Automation at Launch)

At launch time, you’ll provide a **user data script**.

### What the script does

* Downloads the employee directory app
* Installs dependencies
* Starts the web server automatically

### Why this matters

🚀 This is **infrastructure automation**
No manual SSH + setup every time.

---

## 4️⃣ Create a Security Group (Instance Firewall)

You’ll create a **security group** and attach it to the EC2 instance.

### Purpose

* Allow **internet traffic** to reach your app
* Usually:

  * HTTP (port 80)
  * Maybe HTTPS (port 443)

Security groups are:

* Stateful
* Deny-all inbound by default

📌 No security group rule = no access, even if everything else is correct.

---

## 5️⃣ Test the Application (Validation Step)

Finally, you’ll:

* Open a browser
* Paste the EC2 **public IP**
* See the **Employee Directory Application** 🎉

This confirms:

* Networking works
* Routing works
* Security works
* Application works

---

# 🔄 How to Approach the Lab (Important Advice)

### 🧠 Go slow, not fast

This lab is designed to:

* Reinforce **why** each step exists
* Help you build **mental models**

### 🔁 If something breaks…

That’s good 😄
It means you’re learning.

* Go back a step
* Re-check assumptions
* Use troubleshooting logic from earlier lessons

---

# 🏋️ Why This Lab Is So Important

This lab combines:

| Skill      | You Practice          |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| Networking | VPC, Subnets, Routing |
| Compute    | EC2                   |
| Security   | Security Groups       |
| Automation | User Data             |
| Debugging  | Real AWS failures     |

👉 This is **exactly the level of understanding AWS expects** in:

* Real jobs
* Interviews
* Certifications

---

## 🧠 Final Mindset Tip

> **AWS isn’t about memorizing clicks — it’s about understanding why traffic flows (or doesn’t).**

Take your time, enjoy the build, break things safely, and fix them 💪
That’s how AWS really sticks.
