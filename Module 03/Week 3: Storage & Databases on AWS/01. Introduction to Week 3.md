Welcome to **Week 3** 🎉
This is a **big turning point** in the course.

So far, you’ve built:

* ✅ Compute with **Amazon EC2**
* ✅ Networking with **Amazon VPC**

But there’s a problem…

> 🛑 Your application **can’t remember anything** yet.

No storage = no data
No database = no real app

Week 3 fixes that.

# 🧠 Big Picture: Why Week 3 Matters

Let’s visualize what your **Employee Directory App** needs to become functional:

```
User
 ↓
Web App (EC2)
 ↓
+------------------+
|  Storage         | → Employee photos
|  Database        | → Employee info
+------------------+
```

This week is about **giving memory to your application** 🧠

# 🧩 What You’ll Learn in Week 3 (High-Level)

Week 3 focuses on **two major AWS categories**:

## 1️⃣ Storage on AWS

## 2️⃣ Databases on AWS

And then you’ll **connect them to your app**.

---

# 🗄️ Part 1: Storage on AWS (Files, Images, Objects)

### What problem storage solves

* Where do employee photos go?
* Where do files live long-term?
* How do you store data cheaply and reliably?

### Key service you’ll use

### 👉 **Amazon S3**

#### Why S3?

* Object storage (not tied to a server)
* Highly durable (11 nines!)
* Scales automatically
* Perfect for images, videos, documents

📸 In this course:

* Employee photos → **S3 bucket**
* App reads/writes images → S3

---

# 🧮 Part 2: Databases on AWS (Structured Data)

Now let’s talk about **employee information**:

* Names
* IDs
* Departments
* Roles

This data needs **querying**, not just storage.

AWS has *many* database services — but Week 3 focuses on **two**.

---

## 🟦 Option 1: Relational Databases

### **Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)**

Think:

* Tables
* Rows & columns
* SQL
* Fixed schema

✅ Best when:

* You need complex queries
* Strong relationships between data
* Traditional app designs

---

## 🟨 Option 2: NoSQL Databases

### **Amazon DynamoDB**

Think:

* Key–value
* Extremely fast
* Serverless
* Auto-scaling

✅ Best when:

* Massive scale
* Simple access patterns
* Low latency
* No server management

📌 You’ll **compare RDS vs DynamoDB** instead of memorizing.

---

# 🔄 How Everything Connects (Visual Flow)

```
Browser
  ↓
EC2 (Employee App)
  ↓
+-------------------------+
| S3 → Employee Images    |
| RDS / DynamoDB → Data   |
+-------------------------+
```

Now your app:

* Loads data
* Stores data
* Feels **real**

---

# 🧪 What You’ll Actually DO This Week

✔ Compare AWS storage types
✔ Create an **S3 bucket**
✔ Learn how EC2 talks to S3
✔ Explore database options
✔ Understand **when to use RDS vs DynamoDB**
✔ Complete **Lab 3**
✔ Take quizzes (important!)

---

# 📚 Don’t Skip the Readings (Seriously)

The videos give you:

* **Concepts**

The readings give you:

* **Decision-making skills**
* **Real-world nuance**
* **Exam-level clarity**

📌 AWS exams love:

* “Which service should you choose?”
* “Why not the others?”

The readings prepare you for that.

# 🎯 Week 3 Mindset Shift

> **Weeks 1–2**: Build infrastructure
> **Week 3**: Build *applications that remember*

This is where AWS starts feeling **powerful**, not just technical 💪
