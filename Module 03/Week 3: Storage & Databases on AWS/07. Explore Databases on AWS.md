You’ve reached a **huge milestone** 🎉
So far, you built **compute + networking + storage**.
Now we answer the missing question:

> **Where does the application store employee data like names, roles, locations, badges?**

👉 The answer is **databases**.

---

# 🧠 Why Do We Need a Database?

Your **Employee Directory App** can:

* ➕ Add employees
* 👀 View employees
* ✏️ Edit employees
* ❌ Delete employees

This is **structured data** (rows & columns), so we need a **database**, not files or objects.

# 🏗️ Two Ways to Run Databases on AWS

There are **two main approaches**, and this lesson is all about understanding the **trade-offs**.

---

## 🔹 Option 1: Database on EC2 (You Manage Almost Everything)

📦 Entity: **Amazon EC2**

### How it works

```
EC2 Instance
 ├─ Operating System
 ├─ Database Engine (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
 └─ Your Database
```

### ✅ What AWS does

* Manages physical servers
* Manages data center
* Provides networking & power

### ❌ What YOU must do

* Install database engine
* Configure backups
* Handle scaling
* Set up replication
* Patch OS & DB
* Configure Multi-AZ manually
* Monitor & recover failures

### 🧠 When this makes sense

* Lift-and-shift migration
* Legacy databases
* Very custom configurations

⚠️ **Still a lot of operational work**

---

## 🔹 Option 2: Managed Database with Amazon RDS (Recommended)

📦 Entity: **Amazon RDS**

### How it works

```
Amazon RDS
 ├─ AWS-managed servers
 ├─ AWS-managed OS
 ├─ AWS-managed DB engine
 └─ Your database schema & data
```

### ✅ AWS handles (Undifferentiated Heavy Lifting)

* Database installation
* OS patching
* DB engine patching
* Automated backups
* High availability (Multi-AZ)
* Failover & recovery
* Infrastructure scaling

### ✅ YOU handle (What matters)

* Database schema
* Indexes
* Queries
* Performance tuning
* Access control
* Encryption
* Application logic

💡 **This is the key AWS value proposition**

# 🔁 EC2 vs RDS — Side-by-Side

| Feature          | DB on EC2 | Amazon RDS  |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| OS management    | ❌ You     | ✅ AWS       |
| DB installation  | ❌ You     | ✅ AWS       |
| Patching         | ❌ You     | ✅ AWS       |
| Backups          | ❌ You     | ✅ Automatic |
| Multi-AZ         | ❌ Manual  | ✅ Built-in  |
| Scaling          | ❌ Manual  | ✅ Easier    |
| Schema & queries | ✅ You     | ✅ You       |

🎯 **Conclusion:**

> With RDS, you focus on **data**, not **database servers**.

---

# 🧠 Shared Responsibility Shift (Very Important Concept)

This lesson quietly reinforces the **AWS Shared Responsibility Model**.

```
More control  ◄──────────────►  More convenience
     EC2 DB               Amazon RDS
```

* EC2 = control + responsibility
* RDS = convenience + abstraction

---

# 🧩 Why RDS for the Employee Directory App?

The app needs:

* Structured employee data
* Reliability
* High availability
* Minimal operational overhead

✅ **Amazon RDS fits perfectly**

---

# 📚 What’s Coming Next?

This lesson sets the stage for:

* 🔍 Deep dive into **Amazon RDS**
* 🧠 Understanding relational databases
* ⚖️ Comparing RDS vs DynamoDB later
* 🧪 Hands-on database configuration

---

# 📝 One-Sentence Exam Gold 🏆

> **Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service where AWS handles infrastructure, patching, backups, and availability, while you manage schema, queries, and access.**
