Storage is where your application **remembers things**.
In Week 3, this is the **first big concept** you must master.

Let’s break it down **step by step**, **visually**, and **practically**.

---

# 🧠 Why Storage Matters for the Employee Directory App

Your application needs **different kinds of storage**, not just one.

### It needs to store:

1. 🖥️ **Operating system & app files**
2. 📸 **Employee photos (static assets)**
3. 📊 **Employee data (name, title, location)** → database (later)

This lesson focuses on **(1) and (2)**.

# 🧱 The Two Core Storage Types on AWS

AWS storage falls into **two fundamental categories**:

```
AWS Storage
├── Block Storage
└── Object Storage
```

Understanding this difference is 🔑 to choosing the **right AWS service**.

---

## 🟦 1️⃣ Block Storage (Fast, Editable, OS-Friendly)

### 🧩 How block storage works

Think of a file like a **book** 📘
Block storage **cuts the book into pages**.

```
1 GB File
├── Block 1
├── Block 2
├── Block 3
└── Block N
```

Each block is stored separately.

---

### ✏️ What happens if you edit ONE character?

✅ Only **one block** changes
❌ The rest stays untouched

➡️ Very **efficient for frequent updates**

---

### 🧪 Best use cases

* Operating systems
* Application binaries
* System files
* Databases
* High-transaction workloads

---

### 🛠️ AWS block storage service

### 👉 **Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)**

EBS is typically attached to:

* **Amazon EC2** instances

📌 Think of EBS like:

> “A virtual hard drive plugged into an EC2 server”

---

## 🟨 2️⃣ Object Storage (Simple, Scalable, Durable)

### 🧩 How object storage works

Object storage treats a file as **ONE complete object**.

```
1 GB File
└── Stored as a single object
```

It also stores:

* Metadata
* Unique ID
* File content together

---

### ✏️ What happens if you edit ONE character?

❌ You must **replace the entire file**

➡️ That’s okay when:

* Files don’t change often
* Files are mostly **read**, not edited

---

### 🧪 Best use cases

* Images
* Videos
* Documents
* Backups
* Logs
* Static website assets

---

### 🛠️ AWS object storage service

### 👉 **Amazon S3**

📌 In this course:

* Employee photos → **S3**
* App uploads photos → **S3**
* App retrieves photos → **S3**

---

# 🔍 Block vs Object — Side-by-Side

| Feature         | Block Storage     | Object Storage          |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| File structure  | Split into blocks | Single object           |
| Partial updates | ✅ Yes             | ❌ No                    |
| Performance     | Very fast         | Optimized for scale     |
| Typical use     | OS, apps, DBs     | Images, videos, backups |
| AWS example     | Amazon EBS        | Amazon S3               |

---

# 🧠 Applying This to the Employee Directory App

Let’s map **storage type → real usage**:

```
Employee Directory App
├── EC2 OS & App Files → Block Storage (EBS)
├── Employee Photos → Object Storage (S3)
└── Employee Info → Database (coming next)
```

✔ Photos = accessed often, changed rarely → **Object storage**
✔ System files = updated often → **Block storage**

Perfect match ✅

---

# 🎯 Key Takeaways (Exam + Real World)

* **Block storage** = editable, low-level, server-attached
* **Object storage** = scalable, durable, serverless
* Choose storage based on:

  * How often data changes
  * How it’s accessed
  * Performance needs

> ❗ Never force one storage type to do another’s job

## 🚀 What’s Coming Next

Next lessons will deep dive into:

* 📀 EC2 instance storage & **Amazon EBS**
* ☁️ Object storage with **Amazon S3**
* 🎯 Choosing the **right storage service**
* 🧪 Creating an S3 bucket (hands-on)
