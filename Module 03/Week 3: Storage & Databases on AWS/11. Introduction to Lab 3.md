This exercise is a **big milestone** 🎯
Up to now, you launched compute and networking—but the app still felt *empty*.
**Exercise 3 is where everything finally connects.**

---

## 🚀 What This Lab Is About

Until now:

* ✅ EC2 instance was running
* ❌ No storage for images
* ❌ No database for employee data

In **Exercise 3**, you’ll **complete the architecture** by adding **storage + database** and **prove the app actually works**.

---

## 🧩 Components You Will Add

### 1️⃣ **Object Storage for Images**

📦 **Amazon S3**

You will:

* Create an **S3 bucket**
* Attach a **bucket policy**
* Allow an **IAM role** to access objects
* Upload a test object manually

👉 This bucket stores **employee photos**

---

### 2️⃣ **Database for Employee Data**

🗄️ **Amazon DynamoDB**

You will:

* Create a DynamoDB table
* Use it to store employee records
* Let the app read/write data

👉 This replaces a traditional relational database for simplicity and scale

---

### 3️⃣ **Application Integration**

💻 **Amazon EC2**

Once S3 and DynamoDB are ready:

* The EC2-hosted app connects automatically
* You test adding and viewing employees
* You confirm data persistence

✨ This proves the **full stack works end-to-end**

---

## 🔐 Security You’ll Practice

🛡️ **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

You’ll learn:

* How apps access AWS services **without hardcoding credentials**
* How IAM roles + policies control access securely
* Why bucket policies are critical

---

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Lab Flow (High-Level)

1. Create an **S3 bucket**
2. Configure **bucket policy**
3. Upload an object to S3
4. Create a **DynamoDB table**
5. Launch / connect EC2 app
6. Test:

   * Add employee
   * View employee
   * Confirm data persistence

---

## 🧠 Why This Lab Matters (Exam + Real World)

This lab teaches you how AWS services **work together**, not in isolation:

* EC2 → runs the app
* S3 → stores unstructured data
* DynamoDB → stores structured data
* IAM → controls secure access

👉 This is **core AWS architecture thinking**

---

## 🧯 If Something Breaks…

Totally normal 👍
The advice from the lesson is gold:

> **Go back a few steps and verify nothing was missed**

Common mistakes:

* Wrong bucket name in user data
* Missing bucket policy permission
* DynamoDB table name mismatch
* IAM role not attached

---

## 🏁 Final Takeaway

> **Exercise 3 is where AWS stops being theory and becomes a working system.**

When you finish:

* You’ll have a **fully functional cloud application**
* You’ll understand **real AWS service integration**
* You’ll be much more confident for exams & real projects 💪
