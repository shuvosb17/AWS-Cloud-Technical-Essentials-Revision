When you launch an EC2 instance, **compute alone is useless without storage**.
Just like a laptop needs a disk, **EC2 needs block storage**.

AWS gives you **two block storage options** for EC2:

```
EC2 Block Storage
├── Instance Store (internal disk)
└── Amazon EBS (external disk)
```

Let’s visualize and deeply understand both 👇

---

# 🧠 Big Picture Analogy (Laptop Example)

| Laptop World       | AWS World          |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Built-in SSD       | **Instance Store** |
| External USB / SSD | **Amazon EBS**     |

Both store data, but **their behavior is VERY different**.

---

# 🟦 1️⃣ Instance Store (Temporary, Ultra-Fast)

### 📌 What is Instance Store?

**Instance Store** is **physically attached** to the server running your
**Amazon EC2** instance.

```
Physical Server
├── CPU
├── Memory
└── Local Disk (Instance Store)
```

---

### ⚡ Why it’s fast

* Disk is **inside the same machine**
* No network hop
* Extremely low latency

---

### ❌ The BIG downside (very important)

> **Instance Store is EPHEMERAL**

That means:

* ❌ Stop instance → **DATA LOST**
* ❌ Terminate instance → **DATA LOST**
* ❌ Hardware failure → **DATA LOST**

📢 **You cannot recover Instance Store data**

---

### 🧪 When should you use Instance Store?

✔ Temporary data
✔ Cache files
✔ Buffers
✔ Scratch space
✔ Stateless workloads

❌ Never for important data
❌ Never for databases
❌ Never for app files you care about

---

# 🟨 2️⃣ Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) — Persistent Storage

### 📌 What is EBS?

**Amazon Elastic Block Store** is:

* Network-attached storage
* Separate from the EC2 instance
* Persistent (data survives)

```
EC2 Instance  ←── Network ──→  EBS Volume
```

Think of it as an **external hard drive**.

---

### 🔐 Key characteristics

* ✔ Data survives **stop / terminate**
* ✔ Can detach & attach to another EC2
* ✔ Secure (only attached instances can access)
* ✔ Used as:

  * Boot volume (OS)
  * Data volume (app / DB)

---

### 🔄 Detach & Reattach (Very Important Concept)

You can:

1. Stop EC2
2. Detach EBS volume
3. Attach it to **another EC2 in same AZ**

🧠 This is how recovery & migration works.

---

### 👥 EBS Multi-Attach (Advanced)

Some EBS volume types allow:

* Same volume → **multiple EC2 instances**
* Used for clustered applications

(You’ll see this later in advanced architecture)

# 🧠 Instance Store vs EBS (Crystal Clear)

| Feature                 | Instance Store    | Amazon EBS             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Location                | Inside EC2 server | Network-attached       |
| Speed                   | ⚡ Very fast       | Fast (slightly slower) |
| Persistence             | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes                  |
| Survives stop/terminate | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes                  |
| Detachable              | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes                  |
| Typical use             | Cache, temp       | OS, apps, databases    |

# 🧱 EBS Volume Types (High-Level)

EBS volumes fall into **two big families**:

```
Amazon EBS
├── SSD-backed (performance)
└── HDD-backed (throughput / cost)
```

### 🧠 Simple rule

* **SSD** → Databases, OS, low latency
* **HDD** → Big data, logs, backups

(Details are covered in the reading 👌)

---

# 💾 Backups: EBS Snapshots (VERY IMPORTANT)

### 📌 What is an EBS Snapshot?

A **snapshot** is a **backup of an EBS volume**.

Key points:

* Incremental (only changes saved)
* Stored redundantly
* Used to restore data

```
EBS Volume
   ↓
Snapshot
   ↓
New EBS Volume (Restore)
```

---

### 🧪 Why snapshots matter

* EC2 crashes? → Restore from snapshot
* Data corruption? → Roll back
* Migration? → Create new volume elsewhere

📢 **Snapshots = insurance for your data**

---

# 🧠 Applying This to the Employee Directory App

```
Employee Directory App
├── OS + App files → Amazon EBS
├── Temp files / cache → Instance Store (optional)
└── Photos → Amazon S3 (object storage)
```

✔ OS must persist → **EBS**
✔ App must survive restarts → **EBS**
✔ Photos are objects → **S3**

Perfect architecture 👍

---

# 🎯 Exam & Real-World Takeaways

* Instance Store = **fast but disposable**
* EBS = **persistent & flexible**
* If data matters → **EBS**
* Always snapshot important EBS volumes
* Instance Store ≠ backup storage

> ❗ “Fast” does NOT mean “safe”
